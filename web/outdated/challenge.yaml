  I found this old website that runs your python code, but the security hasn't been updated in years

  I'm sure there's a flag floating around, can you find it?

  [Instancer](https://instancer.tjctf.org/challenge/outdated)
flag:
  file: server/flag.txt

provide:
  - kind: zip
    spec:
      as: server.zip
      exclude:
        - server/flag.txt
      files:
        - server
      additional:
        - path: server/flag.txt
          str: tjctf{fake_flag}
